EchoBot I
Hello, World!

You'll begin learning how to build chatbots in Python by writing two functions to build the simplest bot possible: EchoBot. EchoBot just responds by replying with the same message it receives.

In this exercise, you'll define a function that responds to a user's message. In the next exercise, you'll complete EchoBot by writing a function to send a message to the bot.

Instructions
100 XP
Write a function called respond() with a single parameter message which returns the bot's response. To do this, concatenate the strings "I can hear you! You said: " and message.
Store the concatenated strings in bot_message, and return this result


bot_template = "BOT : {0}"
user_template = "USER : {0}"

# Define a function that responds to a user's message: respond
def respond(message):
    # Concatenate the user's message to the end of a standard bot respone
    bot_message = "I can hear you! You said: {}".format(message)
    # Return the result
    return bot_message

# Test function
print(respond("hello!"))

EchoBot II
Having written your respond() function, you'll now define a function called send_message() with a single parameter message which logs the message and the bot's response.

Instructions
100 XP
Use the user_template string's .format() method to include the user's message into the user template, and print the result.
Call the respond() function with the message passed in and save the result as response.
Log the bot's response using the bot_template string's .format() method.
Send the message "hello" to the bot.


# Create templates
bot_template = "BOT : {0}"
user_template = "USER : {0}"

# Define a function that sends a message to the bot: send_message
def send_message(message):
    # Print user_template including the user_message
    print(user_template.format(message))
    # Get the bot's response to the message
    response = respond(message)
    # Print the bot template including the bot's response.
    print(bot_template.format(response))

# Send a message to the bot
send_message("hello")


Chitchat
Now you're going to leave the simple EchoBot behind and create a bot which can answer simple questions such as "What's your name?" and "What's today's weather?"

You'll use a dictionary with these questions as keys and the correct responses as values.

This means the bot will only respond correctly if the message matches exactly, which is a big limitation. In later exercises you will create much more robust solutions.

The send_message() function has already been defined for you, as well as the bot_template and user_template variables.

Instructions 1/2
50 XP
Define a respond() function which takes in a message argument, checks if the message has a pre-defined response, and returns the response in the responses dictionary if there is a match, or the "default" message otherwise.


# Define variables
name = "Greg"
weather = "cloudy"

# Define a dictionary with the predefined responses
responses = {
  "what's your name?": "my name is {0}".format(name),
  "what's today's weather?": "the weather is {0}".format(weather),
  "default": "default message"
}

# Return the matching response if there is one, default otherwise
def respond(message):
    # Check if the message is in the responses
    if message in responses:
        # Return the matching message
        bot_message = responses[message]
    else:
        # Return the "default" message
        bot_message = responses["default"]
    return bot_message
    
    
    Well Done! Your bot is now able to answer some simple questions. Hit 'Run Code' and call send_message() (which utilizes the new respond() function) in the IPython Shell with the following questions:
"what's today's weather?"
"what's your name?"
"what's your favorite color?"
Hit 'Submit Answer' when you are done.


# Define variables
name = "Greg"
weather = "cloudy"

# Define a dictionary with the predefined responses
responses = {
  "what's your name?": "my name is {0}".format(name),
  "what's today's weather?": "the weather is {0}".format(weather),
  "default": "default message"
}

# Return the matching response if there is one, default otherwise
def respond(message):
    # Check if the message is in the responses
    if message in responses:
        # Return the matching message
        bot_message = responses[message]
    else:
        # Return the "default" message
        bot_message = responses["default"]
    return bot_message

send_message("what's today's weather?")


Adding variety
It can get a little boring hearing the same old answers over and over. In this exercise, you'll add some variation. If you ask your bot how it's feeling, the likelihood that it responds with "oh I'm great!" or "I'm very sad today" should be equal.

Here, you'll use the random module - specifically random.choice(ls) - which randomly selects an element from a list ls.

A dictionary called responses, which maps each message to a list of possible responses, has been defined for you.

Instructions 1/2
50 XP
Import the random module.
If the message is in responses, use random.choice() in the respond() function to choose a random matching response.
If the message is not in responses, choose a random default response.


# Import the random module
import random

name = "Greg"
weather = "cloudy"

# Define a dictionary containing a list of responses for each message
responses = {
  "what's your name?": [
      "my name is {0}".format(name),
      "they call me {0}".format(name),
      "I go by {0}".format(name)
   ],
  "what's today's weather?": [
      "the weather is {0}".format(weather),
      "it's {0} today".format(weather)
    ],
  "default": ["default message"]
}

# Use random.choice() to choose a matching response
def respond(message):
    # Check if the message is in the responses
    if message in responses:
        # Return a random matching response
        bot_message = random.choice(responses[message])
    else:
        # Return a random "default" response
        bot_message = random.choice(responses["default"])
    return bot_message
    
    
    Great job! Adding some variety makes your bot much more fun to talk to. Now, hit 'Run Code' and use send_message() (which utilizes the new respond() function) to ask the bot "what's your name?" 3 times.
Hit 'Submit Answer' when you're done.


# Import the random module
import random

name = "Greg"
weather = "cloudy"

# Define a dictionary containing a list of responses for each message
responses = {
  "what's your name?": [
      "my name is {0}".format(name),
      "they call me {0}".format(name),
      "I go by {0}".format(name)
   ],
  "what's today's weather?": [
      "the weather is {0}".format(weather),
      "it's {0} today".format(weather)
    ],
  "default": ["default message"]
}

# Use random.choice() to choose a matching response
def respond(message):
    if message in responses:
        bot_message = random.choice(responses[message])
    else:
        bot_message = random.choice(responses["default"])
    return bot_message

send_message("what's your name?")


ELIZA I: asking questions
Asking questions is a great way to create an engaging conversation. Here, you'll create the very first hint of ELIZA's famous personality, by responding to statements with a question and responding to questions with answers.

A dictionary of responses with "question" and "statement" as keys and lists of appropriate responses as values has already been defined for you. Explore this in the Shell with responses.keys() and responses["question"].

Instructions
100 XP
Define a respond() function which takes in message as an argument, and uses the string's .endswith() method to check if a message ends with a question mark.
If the message does end with a question mark, choose a random "question" from the responses dictionary. Else, choose a random "statement" from the responses.
Send the bot multiple messages with and without a question mark - these have been provided for you. If you want to experiment further in the Shell, be sure to first hit 'Run Code'.

import random

def respond(message):
    # Check for a question mark
    if message.endswith("?"):
        # Return a random question
        return random.choice(responses["question"])
    # Return a random statement
    return random.choice(responses["statement"])


# Send messages ending in a question mark
send_message("what's today's weather?")
send_message("what's today's weather?")

# Send messages which don't end with a question mark
send_message("I love building chatbots")
send_message("I love building chatbots")



ELIZA II: Extracting key phrases
The really clever thing about ELIZA is the way the program appears to understand what you told it by occasionally including phrases uttered by the user in its responses.

In this exercise, you will match messages against some common patterns and extract phrases using re.search(). A dictionary called rules has already been defined, which matches the following patterns:

"do you think (.*)"
"do you remember (.*)"
"I want (.*)"
"if (.*)"
Inspect this dictionary in the Shell before starting the exercise.

Instructions
100 XP
Iterate over the rules dictionary using its .items() method, with pattern and responses as your iterator variables.
Use re.search() with the pattern and message to create a match object.
If there is a match, use random.choice() to pick a response.
If '{0}' is in that response, use the match object's .group() method with index 1 to retrieve a phrase.


# Define match_rule()
def match_rule(rules, message):
    response, phrase = "default", None
    
    # Iterate over the rules dictionary
    for pattern, responses in rules.items():
        # Create a match object
        match = re.search(pattern,message)
        if match is not None:
            # Choose a random response
            response = random.choice(responses)
            if '{0}' in response:
                phrase = match.group(1)
    # Return the response and phrase
    return response.format(phrase)

# Test match_rule
print(match_rule(rules, "do you remember your last birthday"))


ELIZA III: Pronouns
To make responses grammatically coherent, you'll want to transform the extracted phrases from first to second person and vice versa. In English, conjugating verbs is easy, and simply swapping "me" and 'you', "my" and "your" works in most cases.

In this exercise, you'll define a function called replace_pronouns() which uses re.sub() to map "me" and "my" to "you" and "your" (and vice versa) in a string.

Instructions
100 XP
If 'me' is in message, use re.sub() to replace it with 'you'.
If 'my' is in message, replace it with 'your'.
If 'your' is in message, replace it with 'my'.
If 'you' is in message, replace it with 'me'.

# Define replace_pronouns()
def replace_pronouns(message):

    message = message.lower()
    if 'me' in message:
        # Replace 'me' with 'you'
        return re.sub('me', 'you' , message)
    if 'my' in message:
        # Replace 'my' with 'your'
        return re.sub('my', 'your' , message)
    if 'your' in message:
        # Replace 'your' with 'my'
        return re.sub('your', 'my' , message)
    if 'you' in message:
        # Replace 'you' with 'me'
        return re.sub('you', 'me' , message)

    return message

print(replace_pronouns("my last birthday"))
print(replace_pronouns("when you went to Florida"))
print(replace_pronouns("I had my own castle"))


ELIZA IV: Putting it all together
Now you're going to put everything from the previous exercises together and experience the magic! The match_rule(), send_message(), and replace_pronouns() functions have already been defined, and the rules dictionary is available in your workspace.

Your job here is to write a function called respond() with a single argument message which creates an appropriate response to be handled by send_message().

Instructions
100 XP
Get a response and phrase by calling match_rule() with the rules dictionary and message.
Check if the response is a template by seeing if it includes the string '{0}'. If it does:
Use the replace_pronouns() function on phrase.
Include the phrase by using .format() on response and overriding the value of response.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see how the bot responds to the provided messages!


# Define respond()
def respond(message):
    # Call match_rule
    response, phrase = match_rule(rules,message)
    if '{0}' in response:
        # Replace the pronouns in the phrase
        phrase = replace_pronouns(phrase)
        # Include the phrase in the response
        response = response.format(phrase)
    return response

# Send the messages
send_message("do you remember your last birthday")
send_message("do you think humans should be worried about AI")
send_message("I want a robot friend")
send_message("what if you could be anything you wanted")


Intent classification with regex I
You'll begin by implementing a very simple technique to recognize intents - looking for the presence of keywords.

A dictionary, keywords, has already been defined. It has the intents "greet", "goodbye", and "thankyou" as keys, and lists of keywords as the corresponding values. For example, keywords["greet"] is set to "["hello","hi","hey"].

Also defined is a second dictionary, responses, indicating how the bot should respond to each of these intents. It also has a default response with the key "default".

The function send_message(), along with the bot and user templates, have also already been defined. Your job in this exercise is to create a dictionary with the intents as keys and regex objects as values.

Instructions
100 XP
Iterate over the keywords dictionary, using intent and keys as your iterator variables.
Use '|'.join(keys) to create regular expressions to match at least one of the keywords and pass it to re.compile() to compile the regular expressions into pattern objects. Store the result as the value of the patterns dictionary.

# Define a dictionary of patterns
patterns = {}

# Iterate over the keywords dictionary
for intent, keys in keywords.items():
    # Create regular expressions and compile them into pattern objects
    patterns[intent] = re.compile('|'.join(keys))
    
# Print the patterns
print(patterns)


Intent classification with regex II
With your patterns dictionary created, it's now time to define a function to find the intent of a message.

Instructions
100 XP
Iterate over the intents and patterns in the patterns dictionary using its .items() method.
Use the .search() method of pattern to look for keywords in the message.
If there is a match, return the corresponding intent.
Call your match_intent() function inside respond() with message as the argument and then hit 'Submit Answer' to see how the bot responds to the provided messages.


# Define a function to find the intent of a message
def match_intent(message):
    matched_intent = None
    for intent, pattern in patterns.items():
        # Check if the pattern occurs in the message 
        if pattern.search(message):
            matched_intent = intent
    return matched_intent

# Define a respond function
def respond(message):
    # Call the match_intent function
    intent = match_intent(message)
    # Fall back to the default response
    key = "default"
    if intent in responses:
        key = intent
    return responses[key]

# Send messages
send_message("hello!")
send_message("bye byeee")
send_message("thanks very much!")


Entity extraction with regex
Now you'll use another simple method, this time for finding a person's name in a sentence, such as "hello, my name is David Copperfield".

You'll look for the keywords "name" or "call(ed)", and find capitalized words using regex and assume those are names. Your job in this exercise is to define a find_name() function to do this.

Instructions
100 XP
Use re.compile() to create a pattern for checking if "name" or "call" keywords occur.
Create a pattern for finding capitalized words.
Use the .findall() method on name_pattern to retrieve all matching words in message.
Call your find_name() function inside respond() and then hit 'Submit Answer' to see how the bot responds to the provided messages.


# Define find_name()
def find_name(message):
    name = None
    # Create a pattern for checking if the keywords occur
    name_keyword = re.compile('name|call')
    # Create a pattern for finding capitalized words
    name_pattern = re.compile('[A-Z]{1}[a-z]*')
    if name_keyword.search(message):
        # Get the matching words in the string
        name_words = name_pattern.findall(message)
        if len(name_words) > 0:
            # Return the name if the keywords are present
            name = ' '.join(name_words)
    return name

# Define respond()
def respond(message):
    # Find the name
    name = find_name(message)
    if name is None:
        return "Hi there!"
    else:
        return "Hello, {0}!".format(name)

# Send messages
send_message("my name is David Copperfield")
send_message("call me Ishmael")
send_message("People call me Cassandra")


word vectors with spaCy
In this exercise you'll get your first experience with word vectors! You're going to use the ATIS dataset, which contains thousands of sentences from real people interacting with a flight booking system.

The user utterances are available in the list sentences, and the corresponding intents in labels.

Your job is to create a 2D array X with as many rows as there are sentences in the dataset, where each row is a vector describing that sentence.

Instructions
100 XP
Load the spaCy English model by calling spacy.load() with argument 'en'.
Calculate the length of sentences using len() and the dimensionality of the word vectors using nlp.vocab.vectors_length.
For each sentence, call the nlp object with the sentence as the sole argument. Store the result as doc.
Use the .vector attribute of doc to get the vector representation of each sentence, and store this vector in the appropriate row of X.


# Load the spacy model: nlp
nlp = spacy.load('en')

# Calculate the length of sentences
n_sentences = len(sentences)

# Calculate the dimensionality of nlp
embedding_dim = nlp.vocab.vectors_length

# Initialize the array with zeros: X
X = np.zeros((n_sentences, embedding_dim))

# Iterate over the sentences
for idx, sentence in enumerate(sentences):
    # Pass each each sentence to the nlp object to create a document
    doc = nlp(sentence)
    # Save the document's .vector attribute to the corresponding row in X
    X[idx, :] = doc.vector
    
    
    
    Intent classification with sklearn
An array X containing vectors describing each of the sentences in the ATIS dataset has been created for you, along with a 1D array y containing the labels. The labels are integers corresponding to the intents in the dataset. For example, label 0 corresponds to the intent atis_flight.

Now, you'll use the scikit-learn library to train a classifier on this same dataset. Specifically, you will fit and evaluate a support vector classifier.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the SVC class from sklearn.svm.
Instantiate a classifier clf by calling SVC with a single keyword argument C with value 1.
Fit the classifier to the training data X_train and y_train.
Predict the labels of the test set, X_test.

# Import SVC
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Create a support vector classifier
clf = SVC(C= 1)

# Fit the classifier using the training data
clf.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Predict the labels of the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Count the number of correct predictions
n_correct = 0
for i in range(len(y_test)):
    if y_pred[i] == y_test[i]:
        n_correct += 1

print("Predicted {0} correctly out of {1} test examples".format(n_correct, len(y_test)))


Using spaCy's entity recognizer
In this exercise, you'll use spaCy's built-in entity recognizer to extract names, dates, and organizations from search queries. The spaCy library has been imported for you, and its English model has been loaded as nlp.

Your job is to define a function called extract_entities(), which takes in a single argument message and returns a dictionary with the included entity types as keys, and the extracted entities as values. The included entity types are contained in a list called include_entities.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a dictionary called ents to hold the entities by calling dict.fromkeys() with include_entities as the sole argument.
Create a spacy document called doc by passing the message to the nlp object.
Iterate over the entities in the document (doc.ents).
Check whether the entity's .label_ is one we are interested in. If so, assign the entity's .text attribute to the corresponding key in the ents dictionary.

# Define included_entities
include_entities = ['DATE', 'ORG', 'PERSON']

# Define extract_entities()
def extract_entities(message):
    # Create a dict to hold the entities
    ents = dict.fromkeys(include_entities)
    # Create a spacy document
    doc = nlp(message)
    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_ in include_entities:
            # Save interesting entities
            ents[ent.label_] = ent.text
    return ents

print(extract_entities('friends called Mary who have worked at Google since 2010'))
print(extract_entities('people who graduated from MIT in 1999'))


Assigning roles using spaCy's parser
In this exercise you'll use spaCy's powerful syntax parser to assign roles to the entities in your users' messages. To do this, you'll define two functions, find_parent_item() and assign_colors(). In doing so, you'll use a parse tree to assign roles, similar to how Alan did in the video.

Recall that you can access the ancestors of a word using its .ancestors attribute.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a spacy document called doc by passing the message "let's see that jacket in red and some blue jeans" to the nlp object.
In the find_parent_item(word) function, iterate over the ancestors of each word until an entity_type() of "item" is found.
In the assign_colors(doc) function, iterate over the doc until an entity_type of "color" is found. Then, find the parent item of this word.
Pass in the spacy document to the assign_colors() function.

# Create the document
doc = nlp("let's see that jacket in red and some blue jeans")

# Iterate over parents in parse tree until an item entity is found
def find_parent_item(word):
    # Iterate over the word's ancestors
    for parent in word.ancestors:
        # Check for an "item" entity
        if entity_type(parent) == "item":
            return parent.text
    return None

# For all color entities, find their parent item
def assign_colors(doc):
    # Iterate over the document
    for word in doc:
        # Check for "color" entities
        if entity_type(word) == "color":
            # Find the parent
            item =  find_parent_item(word)
            print("item: {0} has color : {1}".format(item, word))

# Assign the colors
assign_colors(doc)

Rasa NLU
In this exercise, you'll use Rasa NLU to create an interpreter, which parses incoming user messages and returns a set of entities. Your job is to train an interpreter using the MITIE entity recognition model in Rasa NLU.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a dictionary called args with a single key "pipeline" with value "spacy_sklearn".
Create a config by calling RasaNLUConfig() with the single argument cmdline_args with value args.
Create a trainer by calling Trainer() using the configuration as the argument.
Create a interpreter by calling trainer.train() with the training_data.

# Import necessary modules
from rasa_nlu.converters import load_data
from rasa_nlu.config import RasaNLUConfig
from rasa_nlu.model import Trainer

# Create args dictionary
args = {'pipeline' : "spacy_sklearn"}

# Create a configuration and trainer
config = RasaNLUConfig(cmdline_args = args)
trainer = Trainer(config)

# Load the training data
training_data = load_data("./training_data.json")

# Create an interpreter by training the model
interpreter = trainer.train(training_data)

# Test the interpreter
print(interpreter.parse("I'm looking for a Mexican restaurant in the North of town"))


Data-efficient entity recognition
Most systems for extracting entities from text are built to extract 'Universal' things like names, dates, and places. But you probably don't have enough training data for your bot to make these systems perform well!

In this exercise, you'll activate the MITIE entity recognizer inside Rasa to extract restaurants-related entities using a very small amount of training data. A dictionary args has already been defined for you, along with a training_data object.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a config by calling RasaNLUConfig() with a single argument cmdline_args with value {"pipeline": pipeline}.
Create a trainer and use it to create an interpreter, just as you did in the previous exercise.


# Import necessary modules
from rasa_nlu.config import RasaNLUConfig
from rasa_nlu.model import Trainer

pipeline = [
    "nlp_spacy",
    "tokenizer_spacy",
    "ner_crf"
]

# Create a config that uses this pipeline
config = RasaNLUConfig(cmdline_args = {"pipeline": pipeline})

# Create a trainer that uses this config
trainer = Trainer(config)

# Create an interpreter by training the model
interpreter = trainer.train(training_data)

# Parse some messages
print(interpreter.parse("show me Chinese food in the centre of town"))
print(interpreter.parse("I want an Indian restaurant in the west"))
print(interpreter.parse("are there any good pizza places in the center?"))


SQL basics
Time to begin writing queries for your first hotel booking chatbot! The database has been loaded as "hotels.db" and a cursor, which has access to the database, has already been defined for you as cursor.

Three queries are provided below. Your job is to identify which query returns ONLY the "Hotel California".

You can test each query below by calling the cursor's .execute() method and passing the query in as a string. Then, you can print the results by calling the cursor's .fetchall() method, which takes no arguments.

SELECT name from hotels where price = 'mid' AND area = 'north'



# Import sqlite3
import sqlite3

# Open connection to DB
conn = sqlite3.connect('hotels.db')

# Create a cursor
c = conn.cursor()

# Define area and price
area, price = "south", "hi"
t = (area, price)

# Execute the query
c.execute('SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE area=? AND price=?', t)

# Print the results
print(c.fetchall())
