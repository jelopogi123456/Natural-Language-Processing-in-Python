In this course, I learned natural language processing (NLP) basics, such as how to identify and separate words, how to extract topics in a text,
and how to build your own fake news classifier. I also learned how to use basic libraries such as NLTK, alongside libraries which utilize deep learning 
to solve common NLP problems. This course gave me the foundation to process and parse text as I move forward in my Python learning.
